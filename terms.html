        <h2>7. AI Features, User Control and Data Use</h2>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">7.1</span> <strong>Scope and purpose.</strong> AI Features (where available) are provided to deliver convenience and generate personalized devotional suggestions or notifications. AI output is provided for convenience only and is not professional, legal, medical, or theological advice.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">7.2</span> <strong>User control and opt-out.</strong> You may disable AI Features in App settings at any time. When disabled, no new AI prompts will be sent on your behalf. AI features are off by default for users who opt out.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">7.3</span> <strong>What is processed.</strong> AI processing occurs only on content that you actively and explicitly submit through an AI interface. We will not automatically extract or transmit your stored notes or other User Content for AI processing.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">7.4</span> <strong>Training and model improvement.</strong> Unless you explicitly opt in to a separate training program, content you submit through AI interfaces will not be used to train or improve our models or third-party models. If you opt in, we will make clear what data will be used and for what purpose.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">7.5</span> <strong>Responsibility.</strong> You are responsible for reviewing AI outputs before relying on them. We disclaim liability for reliance on or misuse of AI outputs.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Encryption, Storage, Backups and Device Security</h2>
        <div class="highlight-section">
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.1</span> For technical details, see our Privacy Policy. This section provides a brief summary.</p>
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.2</span> <strong>Transport & server storage.</strong> Grace Journal transmits data over secure channels and stores note content on our servers and Service Providers encrypted at rest. We and our Service Providers store only encrypted representations of notes on servers and cannot decrypt those server-stored encrypted blobs.</p>
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.3</span> <strong>On-device storage.</strong> The App keeps a local copy of your notes on your device so you can edit and access them offline. Local device storage is protected by your device's security features (for example passcode, biometric lock, or operating system encryption).</p>
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.4</span> <strong>Backups and retention.</strong> Encrypted backups that may contain note data are retained for up to 30 days after deletion for disaster recovery. Deleted content is not available to other users or for export. See our Privacy Policy for details on how to request access to your data.</p>
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.5</span> <strong>Device compromise.</strong> We are not responsible for loss, disclosure, modification, or deletion of note content that results from device compromise (for example jailbreaking, rooting, installing untrusted software, or granting third-party apps access to your device storage).</p>
            <p><span class="subsection-number">8.6</span> <strong>Data Export and Backups.</strong> Grace Journal allows you to export personal data currently stored in your account. Deleted notes are not available for export, even if they exist temporarily in backups retained for disaster recovery (up to 30 days). Backups are used solely to restore data in case of system failures and are not accessible to users. See the Privacy Policy for more details on how to request your data.</p>

        <p><span class="subsection-number">9.1</span> <strong>Third-party content.</strong> The App may include or integrate content supplied by third parties (for example Bible translations, commentary, or other licensed texts) that are subject to separate license terms and restrictions ("Third-Party Content").</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">9.2</span> <strong>No sublicense or redistribution rights.</strong> The inclusion of Third-Party Content in the App for the purpose of providing a note-taking or devotional experience does not grant you any license to copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works from, or otherwise redistribute that Third-Party Content outside the App. You may use Third-Party Content only as expressly permitted under the third party's license and these Terms. Any rights to access or view Third-Party Content are subject to the licensors' terms and may be revoked.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">9.3</span> <strong>Your responsibility for content you create or share.</strong> If you create notes that incorporate or reproduce Third-Party Content (for example quoting copyrighted Bible text in a note you share), you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use complies with the applicable third-party license (including any fair-use, quotation, or excerpt rules). You agree that Tinteractive Apps is not responsible for any claim arising from your reproduction, sharing, or other use of Third-Party Content.</p>
        <p><span class="subsection-number">9.4</span> <strong>No warranty and limited availability.</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, availability or continued licensing of Third-Party Content.
